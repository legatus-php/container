## Installation
You can install the Container component using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
composer require legatus/container
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

use function Legatus\Support\service;
use Legatus\Support\Container;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface as PsrContainer;

$container = new Container();

// You can instantiate factories and fetch services from the passed container
$container->factory('some-service', static function (PsrContainer $c) {
    return new SomeService(
        $c->get('some-dependency-of-that-service')
    );
});

// Or, if you prefer, define everything properly
$container->register('some-service', SomeConcreteService::class)
    // Use the service function to inject another service as argument
    ->addArgument(service(SomeServiceNeededAsArgument::class))
    // Otherwise, arguments are treated as raw values
    ->addArgument('this-string-will-be-a-raw-argument');

// You can extend any defined service in Legatus container
$container->extend('some-service-to-extend')
    // You can decorate a service (this will override the service with a child type)
    ->decorate(static function (SomeInterface $service) use ($container) {
        return new DecoratedServiceWithCompatibleInterface(
            $container->get('other-service'),
            $service
        );
    })
    // Or you can inflect it to call methods on it, passing various arguments.
    // This will keep the reference unmodified
    ->inflect(static function (SomeService $service) {
        $service->someMethodInTheService();
    });

// You can add delegate containers
$container->addDelegate($someOtherContainer);
```

# Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
