## Installation
You can install the Container component using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
composer require legatus/container
```

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface as PsrContainer;

$container = new Legatus\Support\Container();

// You can instantiate factories and fetch services from the passed container
$container->register('some-service', static function (PsrContainer $c) {
    return new SomeService(
        $c->get('some-dependency-of-that-service')
    );
});
```

For more details you can check the [online documentation here][docs].

# Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
